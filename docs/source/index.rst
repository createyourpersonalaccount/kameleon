About
-----

Kameleon is a simple but powerful tool to generate customized appliances. With
Kameleon, you make your recipe that describes how to create step by step your
own distribution. At start Kameleon is used to create custom kvm, docker,
VirtualBox, ..., but as it is designed to be very generic you can probably do a
lot more than that.
